Turtle Race Simulation
This script simulates a turtle race using the turtle library. The user is prompted to make a bet on which turtle they think will win the race. The turtles are displayed on the screen with different colors and they race to the finish line. The user's bet is compared to the winning turtle's color and the user is informed if they won or lost the bet.

How to run the script
Make sure you have the turtle library installed by running pip install turtle in your command line.
Run the script using python turtle_race.py
A window will pop up prompting you to make a bet on which turtle you think will win the race. Enter a color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) and press enter.
The race will start and the turtles will move across the screen.
Once the race is over, the script will inform you if you've won or lost the bet based on the turtle color that wins the race.
To exit the program, click on the turtle graphics window.
Note
You can adjust the size of the window by modifying the screen.setup(500, 400) in the script.
You can also adjust the turtle speed by modifying the rand_distance = random.randint(0, 10) in the while loop.
